# topiclongtable

Development of this package was sponsored by Human Predictions, LLC (<http://www.humanpredictions.com>)

This package implements table cells that:

* collapse vertically if the cell above has the same content,
* prevents cells on the right from collapsing if the cell above has a different content,
* is well behaved with respect to `longtable` page breaks,
* and automatically draws the correct separation lines.

The typical use case is a table spanning multiple pages that contains a list of hierarchically organized topics (hence the package name).
